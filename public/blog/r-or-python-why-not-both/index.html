<h2>R or Python? Why not both!</h2>
<p>Being “able to code” seems like a universal skill applicable to any coding issue you may need to solve, right? Sadly, not quite. Let me explain. During this COVID-19 pandemic I got to spend much more time with my family than planned. Because of this, my family was well aware of me schooling-from-home and they were super supportive. My brother, who graduated from UT with a degree in Petroleum Engineering, was particularly stoked when he heard I needed some help on my coding homework. Finally, a topic he knew well and could actually help me with…that is, until he asked me what language I was using.</p>
<p>My Brother: “oh yeah, I can help with that. You just need a for loop, what language does your class use”
Me: R!!
My Brother: <em>crickets</em></p>
<p>Crickets…followed by him saying “okay yeah I can’t help much now, I don’t know R.” But you know how to code? It’s a universal skill right? All wishful thinking. We hit a brick wall becuase his coding language and my coding language were not the same. How to solve this in the future?? KNOW MORE LANGAUGES! Simple, right?</p>
</div>
<div id="your-coding-skills-are-only-ask-good-as-the-language-you-know" class="section level2">
<h2>Your Coding Skills Are Only Ask Good As The Language You Know</h2>
<p>Our first step in solving this language barrier issue in the coding world is learning more coding langauges. R was my first coding langauge, time to add another– Python it is. Why python you may ask? Well, R has a package “reticulate” that lets you use both R and Python at the same time. Amazing, right? I can learn the new coding language python within my native coding langauge R. Let me show you!</p>
<p>First install the magical package reticulate.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)</code></pre>
<p>Once this is installed you can look at the differences between the two langauges. Let’s practice this by looking at how R and Pyhton differ when naming things. Here I tell R that learning for me is “two languages”. Therefore when people ask me what I am learning these days, I can simply run learning in R and the answer will return back seamlessly.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>learning&lt;-&quot;two languages&quot;
learning</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;two languages&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In Python, naming things occurs a little differently. I like to think of it as more a math brained type of system, as to name something you use the equals sign. Bascially, I am telling the computer what the thing I am naming equals. Take a look!</p>
<pre class="python"><code>Smart=&quot;Brooke&quot;
Smart</code></pre>
<pre><code>## &#39;Brooke&#39;</code></pre>
<p>I kind of like python for that reason, it links well with my math brain on simple tasks like naming things.</p>
<p>Using reticulate I will continue my journey of trying to learn another coding language, Python. Hey, if it doesn’t work out as planned, I kind of have grown to love R anyways. :’)</p>
<p>With coding love,
Brooke</p>
