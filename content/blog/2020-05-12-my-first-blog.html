## R or Python? Why not both! 

Being "able to code" seems like a universal skill applicable to any coding issue you may need to solve, right? Sadly, not quite. Let me explain. During this COVID-19 pandemic I got to spend much more time with my family than planned. Because of this, my family was well aware of me schooling-from-home and they were super supportive. My brother, who graduated from UT with a degree in Petroleum Engineering, was particularly stoked when he heard I needed some help on my coding homework. Finally, a topic he knew well and could actually help me with...that is, until he asked me what language I was using. 

My Brother: "oh yeah, I can help with that. You just need a for loop, what language does your class use"
Me: R!!
My Brother: *crickets* 

Crickets...followed by him saying "okay yeah I can't help much now, I don't know R." But you know how to code? It's a universal skill right? All wishful thinking. We hit a brick wall becuase his coding language and my coding language were not the same. How to solve this in the future?? KNOW MORE LANGAUGES! Simple, right?

## Your Coding Skills Are Only Ask Good As The Language You Know

Our first step in solving this language barrier issue in the coding world is learning more coding langauges. R was my first coding langauge, time to add another-- Python it is. Why python you may ask? Well, R has a package "reticulate" that lets you use both R and Python at the same time. Amazing, right? I can learn the new coding language python within my native coding langauge R. Let me show you!

First install the magical package reticulate.



Once this is installed you can look at the differences between the two langauges. Let's practice this by looking at how R and Pyhton differ when naming things. Here I tell R that learning for me is "two languages". Therefore when people ask me what I am learning these days, I can simply run learning in R and the answer will return back seamlessly.  



In Python, naming things occurs a little differently. I like to think of it as more a math brained type of system, as to name something you use the equals sign. Bascially, I am telling the computer what the thing I am naming equals. Take a look!


I kind of like python for that reason, 

Using reticulate I will continue my journey of trying to learn another coding language, Python. Hey, if it doesn't work out as planned, I kind of have grown to love R anyways. :') 

With coding love,
